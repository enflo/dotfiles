# Introduction

This repository holds my configuration files.

# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:enflo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

# Setup

The install.sh script will setup the dotfiles I use on most machines. It asks about each tool, defaulting to yes for those I typically use, and no for those I no longer use, or use as much.

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
